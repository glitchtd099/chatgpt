# Power Grid Simulation

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates a DC power
flow calculation for a small three-bus system. The script is self-contained
and does not require third-party packages.

## Usage

Run the simulation with:

```bash
python power_grid_sim.py
```

The script prints bus voltage angles and line power flows for the example
network. Modify the parameters in `main()` to explore different grid
configurations.
